# Movie-Recommendation-System
My Python code uses Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, gensim, and difflib to create a movie recommendation system. It loads movie data from a CSV file into a DataFrame and processes it to create dense vectors with Doc2Vec. TruncatedSVD reduces the vector dimensionality, and K-means clustering groups similar movies.

The code includes a function that lets me input a movie title I like and finds similar movies based on it. It's a personalized movie recommendation system that's easy to use as a standalone script or customize for portfolio projects. I'm proud of the results it produces and how it enhances the movie-watching experience.

This code is a valuable addition to my portfolio as it showcases my skills in data processing, feature engineering, and machine learning. Try it out to discover new movie favorites and enhance your movie-watching experience. Happy movie hunting!
